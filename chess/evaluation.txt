Piece Scoring
  1. King
    - Endgame Activity
      In the endgame, an active king is key. Where are the pawns? That's where the king should be.

    - Castling
      Very important. If the king has castled, the pawns in front of the king should not really be moved.
      If he hasn't castled, the pawns on the king side (usually) shouldn't be moved.
      More on this in pawn scoring (defective pawns).

    - Midgame
      Basically, the king should just sit on his hands for most the game until the end.


  2. Bishop
    - Basic Scoring
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 |-10|-10| -8| -6| -6| -8|-10|-10|
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  7 | 0 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 0 |   Basically, these are the scores for every square that
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   a white bishop would want to be in. Bishops like long
  6 | 2 | 6 | 12| 10| 10| 12| 6 | 2 |   diagonals (B2,G2), and they also really enjoy having
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   an output in the center of the board there.
  5 | 2 | 8 | 10| 16| 16| 10| 8 | 2 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   Middle game or end game, the behaviour of the bishop is
  4 | 2 | 8 | 10| 16| 16| 10| 8 | 2 |   basically the same.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  3 | 2 | 6 | 12| 10| 10| 12| 6 | 2 |   This isn't all to bishop evaluation, obviously other pieces
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   will effect where the bishop will eventually end up, but
  2 | 0 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 8 | 0 |   in general, this is a decent map in my opinion.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |   Note, that black should flip the board around, not simply
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   multiply by -1 (row 1<->8, 2<->7 etc).
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

    - Outposts
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   Basic outpost values. An output is one where the piece
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   (bishop) is supported by a friendly pawn, and cannot be driven
  7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   by an enemy pawn in the near future.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  6 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 0 |   "The near future" means either all pawns that could attack the
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   outpost piece are either passed the outpost, or blocked by other
  5 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 0 |   pieces of any alignment.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  4 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

    - Mobility
      Basically count the number of available moves to the bishop. Each square available to
      the bishop would probably be weighed the positioning in basic scoring above.

    - Other
      - Traps
        A bishop can lose a tempo if they are trapped. If the bishop ends up at A7 or H7 (say,
        by capturing a pawn), they can become trapped by the simple move b6 or g6 respectively.
        Trapped bishops are either useless (they only attack two squares), or they must lose a
        tempo to get back into the game. They are also a weakness that black can hone in on,
        eventually winning a piece for a pawn.
        A trapped bishop should probably be worth 100, instead of the 325 assigned above.

      - Pawns on the Wings
        If there are pawns on both the A file and the H file, a bishop's value increases,
        especially over a knight's. Bishop can jump back and forth, protecting and attacking
        both sides of the board, while the knight is slow and painful.
        This is more so an issue for the endgame, not so much the midgame.
        Perhaps a new piece value of 350 instead of 325.


  3. Knights
    - Basic Scoring
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 |-30|-20|-20|-20|-20|-20|-20|-30|   Knights hate the side of the board. They have half the number
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   of possible moves there. A knight on the rim is dim.
  7 |-10| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |-10|
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   Knights do enjoy the center, as all pieces do, but knights more so.
  6 | 3 | 10| 15| 20| 20| 15| 10| 3 |   Knight outposts are very strong, and not easily dealt with.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  5 | 3 | 10| 20| 20| 20| 20| 10| 3 |   The values in the 6th rank may be slightly high.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  4 | 3 | 10| 20| 25| 25| 20| 10| 3 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  3 | 3 | 10| 19| 25| 25| 19| 10| 3 |   B3 and F3 are the natural development for the knight, so I
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   value them over D2 and E2 by a few points.
  2 |-10| 10| 15| 17| 17| 15| 10|-10|
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 |-30|-20|-20|-10|-10|-20|-20|-30|
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

    - Outposts
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   Same deal as the bishop outposts. If the knight can't be driven off
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   by an enemy pawn in the near future.
  7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   I'd like to add more to the knight though. If no minor piece can
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   take the knight, increase the bonus further.
  6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  5 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  4 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 7 | 5 | 2 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

    - Mobility
      Basically count the number of available moves to the knight. Each square available to
      the knight would probably be weighed the positioning in basic scoring above, especially
      since the move set for a knight is so small to begin with.


  4. Queens
    - Basic Scoring
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   The Queen. Strange one, this one. The queen loves to be
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   a developed piece, but no one likes developing her.
  7 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   She shouldn't really ever be touched until most other
  6 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 0 |   pieces have been developed. That being said, when the
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   opponent develops the queen early, you always get a small
  5 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 10| 10| 6 | 3 | 0 |   feeling of fear. Scary stuff.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  4 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 10| 10| 6 | 3 | 0 |   The bonuses I'm giving might be a bit small. They seem about
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   right though. A queen at D5 is worth 1/10 of a pawn more. Yeah.
  3 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 0 |   I'll go with that.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |   The queen can't really be on an outpost, since it is worth so
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   much, the opponent will do anything to get rid of it. I think
  1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   these centralized bonuses will be enough to take care of outposts.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H


  5. Rooks
    - Basic Scoring
      Hmm. Rooks don't really care about being in the center of the board. Rooks care about open
      files, or half open files.
      An open file is one where there are no pawns in it at all. The rook can attack the entire column.
      A half open file is one where our pawn has moved out the file somehow, and the rook can apply
      pressure to an enemy pawn or outpost directly.
        Open File Bonus - 25
        Half Open File  - 10

    - Mobility
      A count of the number of squares available to the rook. What else is there?

    - Other
      - Trapped Rook
        It can be that the rook is trapped by it's own king in the corner of the board.
        If that is the case, A large penalty should be applied to try to fix the rook (50?).

      - Pig
        A rook on the 7th rank is called a pig. It likes to gobble pawns. It also tends to
        prevent the enemy king from activating. A bonus should be given to pigs (30?).


Pawn Scoring
  - Advancing
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   Pawns are encouraged to advance and be promoted.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   Pawns in the center are easy to defend while advancing,
  7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -5| -5| 0 | 0 | 0 |   so they are scored higher than the useless wing pawns.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   Side note: wing pawns often lead to draws.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 10| 10| 3 | 3 | 3 |   This board seems backward, but it's not. Pawns of the
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   opposing colour are very strong as they go toward to the
  4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 15| 15| 5 | 5 | 5 |   back rank. They become a strong thread, and must be worth
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   very much. So when black pawns come toward us, they are
  3 | 10| 10| 10| 30| 30| 10| 10| 10|   a threat, and should be valued higher.
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  2 | 50| 50| 50| 50| 50| 50| 50| 50|
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

  - Toward the Center
    Rule of thumb: always capture toward the center. So capture with the piece that will
    become more centralized after the capture. With pieces, this should be covered just by using
    the positional scoring, but with pawns it is not. Just something to keep in mind.

  - File Weights
    Files (A,C,F,H) are generally crappy files to have pawns on. They lead to drawn games in the
    endgame. If possible, we should encourage capturing away from these files.

  - Doubled Pawns
    When two pawns of the same colour are in one file, they tend to get in the way and become a
    weakness that the enemy can hone in on. Doubled pawns should be penalized, say 10 points. Each?

  - Isolated Pawns
    When one pawn is all alone, ie there are no pawns to in the file in either direction directly
    next to the pawn, it becomes very vulnerable. No pawns are available to defend the loner, so
    it becomes very hard to defend. Yet another weakness that can be honed in on. Isolated pawns
    should be penalized as well, say 20 points. Same as the doubled pawn duo (maybe?). They are just that bad.
    Isolated pawns on the wings (a,h) aren't as bad, but tend to still be weak. Maybe 10 points for them.

  - Defective Pawns
    Pawns in front of the king after he has castled are important defencively, so they shouldn't really
    be moved. Fianchetto bishop - fine, but generally the strongest pawn structure in front of the king
    is just the three unmoved pawns. In the mid-game, penalize pawns for moving in front of the king.
    In the endgame however, pawns generally should be moving forward, so remove this penalty.
    This indirectly calculates the king safety, so it's one thing we can safely ignore.

  - Passed Pawns
    Pawns which cannot be attacked by enemy pawns (ever) are super threaty.
    - Add a bonus if it is a protected passed pawn, another pawn protects it.

    - Passed pawns on the wings tend to be better since they are far away from the action, and far
    from any kings or other pieces interfering with their advancing. However, if this is the last
    pawn we have, it's a crappy pawn to have. Leads to drawn games.

    - Remove passed pawn bonus if it is blocked by an enemy piece. If it is block by a friendly
    piece, penalize both the pawn and the piece in order to encourage the blocking piece to get
    out of the way and push the pawn.

    - Factor in king distances. If our king is very close, bonus. If the enemy king is close, penalty.

    - Hmm. I guess the more advanced the pawn is, the better it is. This is factored in by the pawn
    advancing scoring, but maybe not strongly enough. Will have to test that.

    - Rooks! Rooks love to protect passed pawns. But try not to protect it from the front, preferably
    from our back rank. Protecting from the front - the rook just blocks the pawn from promoting.

  - Hash
    Since pawns don't always move, we can possibly hash positions, saving their score.
    This would save on time. Actually, a lot of time. Otherwise, every ply will evalulate pawns.
    And as we look ahead, we will hash any positions that were not previously calculated.











What It Is Using
  Material Score - Of course this is there. If you have a queen to his pawn,
    you are obviously winning.

  Positional Score - Pieces tend to enjoy being in the center, except rooks.
    That being said, they don't like being too close to opposing pieces.
    Central positions are given a few extra points because of how versitile
    any piece becomes. These bonus points become fewer and fewer and you go
    closer to opposing pawns, or to the edge of the board.

  Mobility Score - The more moves there are available to a piece, likely the
    more useful it is. A bonus is given to each minor piece equal to the
    total numbers of possible moves it has, be they safe or not.

  Outposts - A central piece that is protected by a pawn are always threats.
    They are normally very strong, and tend to become a bone in your opponent's
    throat. Bishops and Knights on an outpost are given a small bonus. Knights
    are given a larger bonus. They just like to be on outposts more.

  Rook Scoring - Rooks are slightly different from other pieces, in that they
    tend to like being on the offensive. Rooks tend to hang back and either
    protect pawns, or be the defencive end of a battery. Due to their nature,
    they don't like being in the center of the board. They just like open files.
    They cover the most ground, defend the most squares, and have the some of
    the largest threats in the game - when they are on open files. So, in
    addition to their mobility score, rooks are given a moderate bonus if they
    are in an open file, or a small bonus if they are in a half open file.
    Another thing about rooks. Bruce Pandolfini calls a rook on the seventh
    rank a "pig." As in, it likes to eat up all the pawns. In order to
    encourage this behaviour, a rook on the seventh rank is given a small bonus.

  Pawn Scoring - Pawns...
    Right. Pawns are odd. Since we are only going a few ply, the program will
    not ever notice the actual value of a pawn until late game - until the
    pawn is nearly promoted anyways. To help out, a bonus is given to any pawn
    who advances. Central pawns are given a larger bonus in the hopes that the
    moves e4 or d4 will eventually be played, taking the center. Wing pawns and
    bishop pawns and given less of a bonus since they tend to lead to draws.
    Pawns have other scores associated with them. If a player has two pawns
    in one file, they are called doubled pawns. Doubled pawns tend to be weaker
    because the pawns no longer support one another. To try to prevent the AI
    from doubling pawns up when it has other options, a penalty is attached
    to doubled pawns.
    Similar to doubled pawns, there is what's known as an isolated pawn. An
    isolated pawn has no friendly pawns in either of the files neighbouring it.
    So, the isolated pawn can never be defended by a friendly pawn. Isolated pawns
    tend to become key defencive points, and also a large weakness that the
    opponent can hone in on. In order to help the AI prevent isolating it's
    pawns, a penalty is attached to any isolated pawn.

  King Scoring - The king should really just castle away and do nothing until
    the endgame. To encourage castling, a large penalty is given to the king
    depending on what file he's in. If he's castled, he gets a bonus.
    In the endgame however, king activity is key to success. Depending on
    where the pawns are, the king is given a very large positional score
    in order to get him activated.
